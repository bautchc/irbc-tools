# irbc Tools

This is just a list of Ruby files that I link into my .irbc file to expand what the irb can do a little bit (I tend to use the irb as a general-use calculator). Some things here are specifically only useful to me, but I figured I'd put them somewhere. The goal of a lot of the things here is to minimize the number of keystrokes needed to do any given task, which is why a lot of the classes and methods have cryptic one-letter or two-letter aliases. I will update this any time I have something new I need my irb to do.
